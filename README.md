# Adaptative Large Neighborhood Search for the Multi-Compartment Truck and Trailer Routing Problem (ALNS_MC-TTRP)

This is version 0.1 of a novel heuristic based in Adaptative Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS), to solve both TTRP and MC-TTRP optimization problems. The ALNS_MC-TTRP code has been implemented using R 4.0.2, and it has been tested in Linux clusters running CentOS 6.7 and in Windows 10 laptops.
